## 🎯 What Exactly Is Levels of Consciousness?

Levels of Consciousness is a comprehensive training program created by Scott Oldford that teaches online entrepreneurs how to leverage the power of human behavior and consciousness to scale their businesses. This methodology moves beyond traditional marketing tactics to help business owners understand the deeper psychological drivers that motivate their customers to make purchasing decisions.

The program is built around understanding that all humans operate within four core levels of consciousness in business contexts: Reactive, Willful, Intellectual, and Intuitive. By identifying which level your target customers primarily operate from, you can optimize every aspect of your marketing and sales process to align with their natural behavioral patterns.
